# AMP

“Another Music Player” provides a basic but useful example of Rust/FLTK and
the Soloud sound library.

It should be especially handy for audio books since at startup it restores
the last played track at the exact position it had reached.

Tested on Linux and Windows.

If you want a player than can also manage playlists see [TLM (Track List
Manager)](https://github.com/mark-summerfield/tlm).
